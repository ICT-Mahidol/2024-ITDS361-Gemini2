# Use Case Descriptions
## Use Case: Create a Science Plan
*Use Case Name:* Create a Science Plan  
*ID:* 1 
*Important Level:* High  
*Primary Actor:* Astronomer  
*Stakeholder and Interest:*
- *Astronomer* wants to create a detailed observation plan.
- *Research Institutions* require structured plans for scheduling telescope time.
- *System Administrator* ensures data integrity and security.

*Brief Description:*
The astronomer creates a science plan that outlines the observations they wish to perform.
*Precondition:*
Astronomer must be logged into the system before performing this use case.

*Trigger, Types:*
- *Trigger:* The astronomer initiates the creation of a new science plan.
- *Type:* User-initiated

*Relationships:*  
- *Association:* Astronomer  
- *Include:* -  
- *Extend:* -  
- *Generalization:* -  

### Normal Flow of Events
1. The Astronomer selects the option to create a new science plan.
2. The system provides a template for entering observation parameters which includes the following information:
- Plan ID – Automatically generated by the system.
- Plan Name – Short text format.
- Creator – Automatically populated from the Astronomer's login details.
- Funding – Numerical value in dollars with decimals.
- Objective – Long text format.
- Start and End Dates – The Astronomer selects from the calendar.
- Telescope Assigned – The Astronomer selects from the list of two available telescopes: Hawaii and Chile.
- Target – The Astronomer selects a target from the catalog of stars.
3. The Astronomer fills in the required details.
4. The Astronomer saves the plan.
5. The system confirms that the plan
6. The Astronomer modify a science plan

### Subflows
- *5.1* if the science plan is complete, has been created successfully.
- *5.2* if the science plan is incomplete, the system prompts for missing details and returns to step 3.
- *6.1* if modify, the astronomer modify the science plan
- *6.2* if not modify, the science plan has been created successfully.

### Alternate/Exceptional Flow
- *If the system encounters an error while saving,* it notifies the astronomer and requests a retry.
- *If required parameters are missing,* the system highlights the missing fields and returns to step 3.

## Use Case: Test a Science Plan
*Use Case Name:* Test a Science Plan  
*ID:* 2
*Important Level:* High  
*Primary Actor:* Astronomer  
*Stakeholder and Interest:*
- *Astronomer* ensures the feasibility of the plan before submission.
- *System Administrator* monitors simulation performance.

*Brief Description:*
The astronomer tests a science plan before submission to ensure feasibility and accuracy.
*Precondition:*
Astronomer must be logged into the system before performing this use case.

*Trigger, Types:*
- *Trigger:* The astronomer selects a plan for testing.
- *Type:* User-initiated

*Relationships:*  
- *Association:* Astronomer  
- *Include:* Operate the Interactive Observing (Virtual Telescope)  
- *Extend:* -  
- *Generalization:* -  

### Normal Flow of Events
1. The Astronomer selects the “Test Science Plan” button.
2. The system displays a list of all science plans available for testing.
3. The Astronomer selects an existing science plan for testing.
4. The system loads the selected science plan and prepares the data for testing.
5. The system evaluates the results of the tests.
6. The Astronomer updates the status of the science plan that has passed the test.
7. The Astronomer clicks the “Finish” button to complete the process.
8. The system records the completion of the testing process and updates the data in the system.
### Subflows
- *5.1* If all test cases pass, the system updates the status of the science plan to “TESTED” and displays a confirmation message along with the test results.
- *5.2* If any test case fails, the system displays an error message specifying the failed test case and provides suggestions for correction.

## Use Case: Submit a Science Plan
*Use Case Name:* Submit a Science Plan  
*ID:* 4
*Important Level:* High  
*Primary Actor:* Astronomer  
*Stakeholder and Interest:*
- *Astronomer* ensures that the plan is successfully submitted for execution.
- *Research Institutions* rely on submitted plans for scheduling observations.

*Brief Description:*
The astronomer submits a validated science plan for execution.
*Precondition:*
Astronomer must be logged into the system before performing this use case.

*Trigger, Types:*
- *Trigger:* The Astronomer submits the plan.
- *Type:* User-initiated

*Relationships:*  
- *Association:* Astronomer  
- *Include:* -  
- *Extend:* -  
- *Generalization:* -  

### Normal Flow of Events
1. The Astronomer navigates to the Science Plan section
2. The system displays the Science Plans page, listing all science plans created by the Astronomer.
3. The Astronomer can filter science plans by status: Created, Tested, Submitted, Validated, Executed.
4. The Astronomer selects a science plan to submit.
5. The system prompts the Astronomer to confirm the submission of the selected science plan.

### Subflows
- *5.1* If the Astronomer selects “Confirm”, the system submits the selected science plan.
- *5.2*  If the Astronomer selects “Cancel”, the system returns to the list of science plans (back to Step 2).
### Alternate/Exceptional Flow
- *If the Astronomer has no existing science plans, the system displays an empty page with a button to create a new science plan
- *The Astronomer can only submit science plans with the status “TESTED.”
