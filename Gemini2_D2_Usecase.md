# Use Case of Observatory Control System (OCS)

## Use Case 1: Create Science Plan
###  Description:
This use case describes how an astronomer creates a science plan for observations, specifying parameters such as coordinates, time, and equipment to use.

## Use Case 2: Validate Science Plan
###  Description:
This use case describes how a science observer validates and tests the correctness of a science plan.

## Use Case 3: Convert Science Plan to Observing Program
###  Description:
This use case describes how a science observer converts a validated science plan into an observing program.

## Use Case 4: Execute Observation
###  Description:
This use case describes how a science observer executes an observation based on an observing program.

## Use Case 5: Remote Telescope Control
###  Description:
This use case describes how a telescope operator remotely controls the telescope.

## Use Case 6: Do Observation Scheduling  
###  Description:
This use case describes an automated sequencing process to ensure that telescope usage is managed efficiently, without people competing for use or getting broken telescopes.

## Use Case 7: View Real-time Data Analysis
###  Description:
This use case describes how astronomers and observers can view real-time analysis data during an observation.

## Use Case 8: Address Error Detection from System
###  Description:
This use case describes the process by which an Administrator resolves or reports an issue that the system has notified of an anomaly detected.

## Use Case 9: Manage Data 
###  Description:
This use case is a process where astronomers can manage the data obtained from this observation, including recording and checking the data.

## Use Case 10: Calibrate Instrument
###  Description:
This use case is the process of customizing and comparing measurement tools to make them work more accurately.

## Use Case 11: Monitor System Health 
###  Description:
This Use Case is the process of checking the system status through System Health Monitoring to detect and resolve problems.

## Use Case 12: Manage User Roles
###  Description:
This use case describes how a user manages roles and permissions within the system, including assigning or modifying access levels for different users.  

## Use Case 13: Monitor Security
###  Description:
This use case describes how an administrator monitors system activities to detect and respond to potential security threats.  

## Use Case 14: Authenticate User
###  Description:
This use case describes how the system verifies a user's identity before granting access to the system

## Additional System

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
####  Description:
This use case ensures secure access to the Observatory Control System by requiring multiple layers of authentication before granting access to critical system features.

### Weather Monitoring Integration
####  Description:
This use case integrates real-time weather monitoring data into the system to aid observation scheduling and ensure telescope safety.

### Log Data
####  Description:
This use case enables the system to log all observation data, system events, and operational activities for analysis and auditing purposes.
